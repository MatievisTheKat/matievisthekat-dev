      <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
      <p>
        It is Matievisthekat.dev's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
        information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
        Policy applies to
        <a href="https://matievisthekat.dev">https://matievisthekat.dev</a>
        (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://matievisthekat.dev"). We respect
        your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
        information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this
        privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be
        collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
        circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This
        Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the
        Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other
        sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on
        our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use
        of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website,
        you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, Matievisthekat.dev collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. Matievisthekat.dev's purpose in collecting non-personally
        identifying information is to better understand how Matievisthekat.dev's
        visitors use its website. From time to time, Matievisthekat.dev may
        release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
        by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matievisthekat.dev also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
        and for users leaving comments on https://matievisthekat.dev blog posts.
        Matievisthekat.dev only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
        addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.
      </p>

      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to Matievisthekat.dev's websites choose to interact
        with Matievisthekat.dev in ways that require Matievisthekat.dev to
        gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
        information that Matievisthekat.dev gathers depends on the nature of the
        interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
        https://matievisthekat.dev to provide a username and email address.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

        and terms and conditions of every site you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content,
        privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
        services.

        feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
        help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
        users. Matievisthekat.dev takes all measures reasonably necessary to
        protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
