  204: "The HTTP 204 No Content success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded, but that the client doesn't need to go away from its current page. A 204 response is cacheable by default. An ETag header is included in such a response.",

However, no standard use convention exists and different entities use it in different contexts.",

This status is similar to 401, but in this case, re-authenticating will make no difference. The access is permanently forbidden and tied to the application logic, such as insufficient rights to a resource.",
  404: "The HTTP 404 Not Found client error response code indicates that the server can't find the requested resource. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links and can be subject to link rot. A 404 status code does not indicate whether the resource is temporarily or permanently missing. But if a resource is permanently removed, a 410 (Gone) should be used instead of a 404 status.",

For example, you may get a 409 response when uploading a file which is older than the one already on the server resulting in a version control conflict.",
  410: "The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 410 Gone client error response code indicates that access to the target resource is no longer available at the origin server and that this condition is likely to be permanent. If you don't know whether this condition is temporary or permanent, a 404 status code should be used instead.",

This happens with conditional requests on methods other than GET or HEAD when the condition defined by the If-Unmodified-Since or If-None-Match headers is not fulfilled. In that case, the request, usually an upload or a modification of a resource, cannot be made and this error response is sent back.",

The format problem might be due to the request's indicated Content-Type or Content-Encoding, or as a result of inspecting the data directly.",
  416: "The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 416 Range Not Satisfiable error response code indicates that a server cannot serve the requested ranges. The most likely reason is that the document doesn't contain such ranges, or that the Range header value, though syntactically correct, doesn't make sense.",

A combined coffee/tea pot that is temporarily out of coffee should instead return 503. This error is a reference to Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol defined in April Fools' jokes in 1998 and 2014. Some websites use this response for requests they do not wish to handle, such as automated queries.",

  428: "The HTTP 428 Precondition Required response status code indicates that the server requires the request to be conditional. Typically, this means that a required precondition header, such as If-Match, is missing. When a precondition header is not matching the server side state, the response should be 412 Precondition Failed.",

This error response is a generic 'catch-all' response. Usually, this indicates the server cannot find a better 5xx error code to response. Sometimes, server administrators log error responses like the 500 status code with more details about the request to prevent the error from happening again in the future.",

Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. This response should be used for temporary conditions and the Retry-After HTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time for the recovery of the service.",

In that specification a client may send a request that contains an extension declaration, that describes the extension to be used. If the server receives such a request, but any described extensions are not supported for the request, then the server responds with the 510 status code.",
